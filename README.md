# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The clone is AJAX based, using JQuery, HTML and CSS to make it functional. It is the second main project during my journey to become LHL graduate. This project helped me understand above mentioned technologies and how they are worked in conjuntion with each other. 

**Stretch Activity**

In addition to the main requirement to complete this course, a stretch activity was also incorporated which toggle's the form behavior that hides or shows when a user clicks a button on top right.
